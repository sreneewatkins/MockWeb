/*
@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the
following:

@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the
application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based
on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
@EnableWebMvc: Flags the application as a web application and activates
key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet. Spring Boot adds
it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath.
@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations,
and services in the the com.example.testingweb package, letting it find
the HelloController class.
